# How to Use the Cursor Build Plan and Prompts Correctly

This document explains **how to combine the Step-by-Step Build Plan and the Broken-Down Prompts** effectively.

---

## Core Rule
- Step-by-Step Build Plan = Roadmap
- Broken-Down Prompts = Execution

Never paste the roadmap into Cursor.

---

## How to Work Day-to-Day

1. Check the Build Plan to see which phase you are in.
2. Choose the matching Broken-Down Prompt.
3. Open the relevant file or folder in Cursor.
4. Paste ONE prompt.
5. Review the generated code.
6. Commit changes.
7. Move to the next prompt.

---

## What NOT to Do
- Do not mix frontend and backend in one prompt.
- Do not paste multiple prompts together.
- Do not skip phases.

---

## Mental Model
- Cursor = Junior developer
- You = Tech lead

You decide **what** to build.
Cursor implements **how**.

---

## Pro Tips
- Always scope context ("in this file", "using existing components")
- Repeat stack constraints when needed
- Commit often

---

## Outcome
Cleaner code, fewer rewrites, and a production-ready application.
